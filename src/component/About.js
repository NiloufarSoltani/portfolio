            My path into frontend development wasnâ€™t linear â€” but it was driven
            by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to build things people
            actually use.
            <br />
            I got my start in tech by exploring HTML and CSS at a small startup,
            where I discovered how exciting it is to bring interfaces to life in
            the browser. That early experience quickly grew into a passion for
            frontend development, and I soon found myself diving deeper into
            JavaScript, React, and the entire modern frontend ecosystem. <br />
            Along the way, I also gained hands-on experience in software
            testing, which helped me understand how products behave under
            real-world conditions. But while testing gave me a strong eye for
            quality, my heart was always in building â€” so I made a full
            transition to frontend development. <br />
            As a developer at Rasha, I worked on React-based applications,
            improving both the codebase and the user experience. I learned how
            to collaborate across design, QA, and backend teams, and I built
            real features used by real people. <br />
            In 2022, after moving to Canada, I continued working remotely with
            Rasha before joining Saichologist, a Denmark-based mental wellness
            startup, as a Frontend Developer. In this role, Iâ€™ve helped shape
            the UI from scratch, implementing new features, collaborating on UX
            decisions, and focusing on performance, scalability, and clean
            architecture. <br />
            Now, Iâ€™m fully focused on frontend â€” bringing together creativity,
            problem-solving, and a deep respect for users. With a diverse skill
            set, an unwavering work ethic, and a burning passion for front-end
            development, I am ready to take on new challenges, contribute to
            innovative projects, and immerse myself in the dynamic tech
            landscape of Toronto. I eagerly await the opportunity to connect
            with like-minded professionals, whether it be in a remote or on-site
            capacity. <br />
            This is the story of my journey so far, and I am excited to see what
            the future holds as I continue to pursue my dream career in
            front-end development.
